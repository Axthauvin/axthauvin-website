# Introduction

This project is a graphical interface for the [docx2pdf](https://pypi.org/project/docx2pdf/) module, which converts docx files to pdf.

# Description

### A Simple Tool to Find for Efficient Use

Having to search for a site to convert Word files to PDF was too painful.
Today, I can solve this problem with a few clicks 🖱️.

As we can see, it's very easily accessible

### The Interface

I'll admit, it's not the most _sexy_ interface in the world

The idea is simple, I have 2 options:

- Convert **_one file_** from DOCX to PDF
- Convert **_all files in a folder_** that are in DOCX to PDF

# Introduction

[Pathfinding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinding) consists of finding a way to move in an environment between a starting point and an end point, taking into account different constraints

# Description 
The program consists of taking the player from one point to another using the shortest path.
The player is represented by the red square üü•.


When the mouse is clickedüñ±Ô∏è, it will automatically move towards it avoiding the walls.

The interesting part was to add the notion of ***constraints***; which aims to add obstacles on a path (for example traffic jams), which slow down the character (represented by the blue squares üü¶).
Thus, the program must determine the fastest path, taking into account its length, as well as its constraints.

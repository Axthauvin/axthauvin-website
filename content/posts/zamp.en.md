# ZAMP ? What is it ?:

ZAMP is designed to simplify the process of setting up a local development environment. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, ZAMP provides a hassle-free way to get your web server up and running with minimal effort. By integrating essential tools like Apache, MySQL, and PHP into a single package, ZAMP ensures that you can focus on coding rather than configuration.

 The app is still in development, and is intended to be open source, so the community can improve and customize it.

## Overview

**ZAMP** is an all-in-one development stack for web developers, **providing everything you need** for ***local*** web development. It seamlessly integrates Apache, MySQL, and PHP, eliminating the need for individual installations.
With **zero configuration required**, ZAMP streamlines your development process, allowing you to focus solely on building your application. Additionally, starting all services is as simple as a single click, enhancing your productivity and efficiency.

## Features

- **Extension Management**: Enable or disable PHP extensions with a simple checkbox interface.
- **Version Control**: Download and switch between different PHP versions with ease.
- **MySQL / MariaDB Launcher**: Simply click to open and close your SQL instance.
- **Drag and Drop Project Setup**: Simply drag and drop your project folders into ZAMP to get started.

## Installation

Currently, ZAMP is only available for Windows. We are actively working on making ZAMP available for macOS and Linux in the near future. Stay tuned for updates!

### Windows

2. Extract the archive to your preferred location.
3. Run `zamp.Setup.1.0.0.exe`.


## Usage

Once installed, you can access the following services:

- **Apache**: Clicking the start button 
![Start button](./src/explanations/Startbutton.png)

- **PHPMyAdmin**: PHP will automatically configure itself within the app. 
You can still change the version or the extensions using the dedicated areas.

- **My SQL / Maria DB** : ZAMP uses MariaDB to run the SQL as it has binaries. MariaDB is retro compatible with MySQL, so you can still use workbench to access your server.

You can access the SQL server in the dedicated area

# How the program works :

At the request of the headmaster of the [Notre Dame High School](http://www.indblr.asso.fr/), I designed and produced, in compliance with the requested specifications, a website allowing to report very quickly from a smartphone or a computer, to the concerned staff of the school the absence of one of their colleagues as soon as a member of the board of directors is aware of the information.



# Description 
The user has a trombinoscope on which it is enough to search for the photo of the absent person, or to search for the name in the dedicated search bar.

*UI of the web site*

{{< encadres type="danger" titre="Noteworthy" >}}
 In order to respect the image rights of the personnel of the establishment, the photos and names presented here were generated by computer, and are in no way real people.
{{< /encadres >}}




Then, with a simple click üñ±Ô∏èon the photo of the person concerned, he or she is noted as absent. *The photo then turns red*.

Thus, it is very easy to see if a staff member has already been marked absent by someone else.

Then, ***an email is sent*** to a list of predefined people (those who must know that the person is absent)

### A completely autonomous program

The advantage for the user is that I created a graphical interface to edit the database. Thus, the user even without programming knowledge can easily update the database thanks to a dedicated interface.

The few fields make the program easier to use.

  It is also possible to add and remove people from the database only with a few clicks.

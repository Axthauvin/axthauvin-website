# Introduction

This project is a graphical interface to the [docx2pdf] module (https://pypi.org/project/docx2pdf/), which consists of converting docx files to pdf.

# Description
### A simple tool to find for an efficient use

Having to search for a site to convert words into PDF was too painful.
Today, I can in a few clicks üñ±Ô∏è overcome this problem.

As you can see, it is very easily accessible

### The interface

{{< encadres-markdown type="note" title="The idea is simple, I have 2 options open to me: " >}}
 - Convert ***a DOCX file*** to PDF
 - Convert ***all files in a folder*** that are DOCX to PDF

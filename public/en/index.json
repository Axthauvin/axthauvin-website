What is it ?: ZAMP is designed to simplify the process of setting up a local development environment. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re a seasoned developer or just starting out, ZAMP provides a hassle-free way to get your web server up and running with minimal effort. By integrating essential tools like Apache, MySQL, and PHP into a single package, ZAMP ensures that you can focus on coding rather than configuration.\n‚ö†Ô∏è To take in consideration The app is still in development, and is intended to be open source, so the community can improve and customize it.\rOverview ZAMP is an all-in-one development stack for web developers, providing everything you need for local web development. It seamlessly integrates Apache, MySQL, and PHP, eliminating the need for individual installations. With zero configuration required, ZAMP streamlines your development process, allowing you to focus solely on building your application. Additionally, starting all services is as simple as a single click, enhancing your productivity and efficiency.\nFeatures Zero Configuration: Just install and run. No need to spend hours configuring your environment. Integrated Management: Easily manage Apache, MySQL, and PHP services from a single interface. Extension Management: Enable or disable PHP extensions with a simple checkbox interface. Version Control: Download and switch between different PHP versions with ease. MySQL / MariaDB Launcher: Simply click to open and close your SQL instance. Drag and Drop Project Setup: Simply drag and drop your project folders into ZAMP to get started. Installation Currently, ZAMP is only available for Windows. We are actively working on making ZAMP available for macOS and Linux in the near future. Stay tuned for updates!\nWindows Download the latest ZAMP for Windows. Extract the archive to your preferred location. Run zamp.Setup.1.0.0.exe. Usage Once installed, you can access the following services:\nApache: Clicking the start button PHPMyAdmin: PHP will automatically configure itself within the app. You can still change the version or the extensions using the dedicated areas. My SQL / Maria DB : ZAMP uses MariaDB to run the SQL as it has binaries. MariaDB is retro compatible with MySQL, so you can still use workbench to access your server.\nYou can access the SQL server in the dedicated area\nüí°Informations Statut : En d√©veloppement Langage utilis√© : Electron, HTML, CSS, Apache\r","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/posts/zamp/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"zamp--what-is-it-\"\u003eZAMP ?
